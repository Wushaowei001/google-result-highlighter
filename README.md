## Contribution

I did it for myself so that's why I will keep maintaining and add some new features for my needs. However anyone is free to request or implement new features.

In addition since this is my first extension attempt and javascript front-end experience, code style may not be good or may work inefficiently. I would be very pleased hear suggestions to improve this. Also my design and html skills are bad as you can see from Options page, so a little help would be very good.
